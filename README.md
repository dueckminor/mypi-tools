## Tools

### mypi-setup

Runs on your PC/Notebook and creates an SD-Card for a automated installation
of Alpine-Linux on a Raspberry-PI. It's not necessary to connect a keyboard
or display to your Raspberry-PI. All you need is a network cable and a power
supply.

When you start `mypi-setup` a browser window will open. Just follow the
instructions and you will get a SD-Card ready for your Raspberry-PI. After
you have inserted this SD-Card to your Raspberry-PI, `mypi-setup` will connect
to it and completes the installation.

### mypi-control

Runs on your Raspberry-PI and

- completes the installation
  - makes the image bootable from disk (this requires less memory)
  - install basic packages like
    - `docker`
    - `bash`
    - `jq`
- provides a managment Web-UI

### mypi-auth

### mypi-router

### mypi-videostream

## Dev-Environment

To allow debugging of the GoLang and Web Applications you could use do the
following:

1. mount your `mypi` installation of your Raspberry-PI in the same directory
as it is remote:

```bash
sshfs pi@rpi.fritz.box:/opt/mypi /opt/mypi
```

2. call the `prepare_debug` script:

```bash
./scripts/prepare_debug
```
